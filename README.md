## What's all this about?

I love CSS! I wanted to build something fun to celebrate the language and the work of [the people who make it](https://twitter.com/csswg).

Please enjoy this app! It's built with Next 13 and uses OG Image Generation, so when you share your poem with the world the preview will appear the same as you see it on the site.
